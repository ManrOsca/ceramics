Use scripts to emulate the function of a mailto: URL. The idea is to create a link on your page that submits the username and domain of the email address to a program that builds the mailto: URL dynamically and returns it to the user's browser.

The following JavaScript function can also obscure mail addresses:
<a href='javascript:window.location="mail"+"to:"+"user"+"@"+"domain"+"."+"com";' onmouseover='window.status="mail"+"to:"+"user"+"@"+"domain"+"."+"com"; return true;' onmouseout='window.status="";return true;'>Click here to send mail.</a>

This returns a mailto: link to  user@domain.edu , but the username and domain appear broken up in the source HTML file, protecting them from harvest scripts.

Note: This requires your visitors to have JavaScript enabled in their browsers; you may want to note this on your page.
